# VSRBiodiversity
This is the official repository for the GECCO 2021 paper "Biodiversity in Evolved Voxel-based Soft Robots".

It relies on:

* [JGEA](https://github.com/ericmedvet/jgea), for the evolutionary optimization;

* [2D-VSR-Sim](https://github.com/ericmedvet/2dhmsr), for the simulation of VSRs.

This work is partially based on Marco Rochelli's master's thesis (https://github.com/MarcoRochelli/Co-evolution).
