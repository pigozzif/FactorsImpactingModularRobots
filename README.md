# VSRBiodiversity
This is the official repository for the GECCO (Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference-2021) paper "Biodiversity in Evolved Voxel-based Soft Robots", hosting all the code necessary to replicate the experiments. This work is partially based on Marco Rochelli's master's thesis (https://github.com/MarcoRochelli/Co-evolution) and was carried on at the Evolutionary Robotics and Artificial Life Laboratory (ERALLab) at the Department of Engineering and Architecture, University of Trieste (Italy).

## Scope
By running the main file (`Main.java`), you will launch an evolutionary optimization for evolving jointly the body (number and arrangement of the voxels) and brain (the controller, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)) of Voxel-based Soft Robots (VSRs). At the same time, a number of evolution metadata and interesting features will be saved inside the `output` folder. Features include descriptors of VSRs that we devised as a way of characterizing their shape and behaviour. We employed them (in a supervised learning pipeline) to assign each robot to a species, measure biodiversity in VSRs and study how it mutates as the evolutionary algorithm and the controller representation are changed.

## Structure
* `src` contains all the source code for the project;
* `libs` contains the .jar files for some of the dependencies (see below);
* `Data_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb` is Jupyter Notebook (Python) with some routines and starter code to perform analysis on the evolution output files.

## Dependencies
It relies on:
* [JGEA](https://github.com/ericmedvet/jgea), for the evolutionary optimization;
* [2D-VSR-Sim](https://github.com/ericmedvet/2dhmsr), for the simulation of VSRs.

The relative jars have already been included in the directory `libs`. See `pom.xml` for more details on dependencies.

## Usage
This is a table of possible command-line arguments:

Argument       | Type                                         | Optional (yes/no) | Default
---------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------
evolver        | {cmaes, ga, se-geno, se-shape, se-behaviour} | no                | -
representation | {homogeneous, heterogeneous}                 | no                | -
seed           | integer                                      | no                | -
threads        | integer                                      | yes               | # available cores on CPU

where {...} denotes a finite and discrete set of possible choices for the corresponding argument. The description for each argument is as follows:
* evolver: the evolutionary algorithm to perform optimization with.
* representation: the representation for the robotic controller. For this work, we use a distributed model (one ANN for each voxel), of which we devised two alternatives, _homogeneous_ and _heterogeneous_. In the former, all the ANNs share the same weights; in the latter, different voxels have different weights.
* seed: the random seed for the experiment.
* threads: the number of threads to perform evolution with. Defaults to the number of available cores on the current CPU. Parallelization is taken care by JGEA and implements a distributed fitness assessment.
