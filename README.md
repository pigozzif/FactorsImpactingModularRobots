# VSRBiodiversity
This is the official repository for the GECCO 2021 paper "Biodiversity in Evolved Voxel-based Soft Robots".

It relies on:

* JGEA, for the evolutionary optimization;

* 2D-VSR-Sim, for the simulation of VSRs.

This work is partially based on Marco Rochelli's master's thesis (https://github.com/MarcoRochelli/Co-evolution).
